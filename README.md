# Sahib Dairy App

<img src="https://github.com/RajvirSingh1313/Sahib-Dairy-App/blob/master/public/ReadmeBanner.png"/>

### I know it is a client's property but I did that for free so I can share it with the community, and I need to repay my debt from the community on me as the open-source community helped me a lot, all the data is saved in the IndexedDB. Btw I coded the design like hardcore it is not optimized for desktop as my client was needing it as a PWA and he is using iPhone 8+ so it is optimized specifically for the 8+

# Why?
One day I decided to do some favor for dairy owner as he done for me too, thats it and you would be like wtf, how can you just give it away as anybuddy can steal his data then jokes on you, I used IndexedDB lol.

# How to use it
First get a dairy shop then call me to get permission, thats it. And app it is self explaining, And all stockes unit is equal to kgs and if you are in country where you guys use lbs or something like that then also you can just use it fine.

Thats it

# How to start it
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
